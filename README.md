# Introduction to Git
Git is a powerful and widely-used distributed version control system that has transformed the way developers manage and collaborate on software projects. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows teams to track changes in their codebase, manage multiple versions of their projects, and facilitate collaboration among developers, regardless of their geographical location.
At its core, Git provides a robust framework for recording changes to files, enabling users to revert to previous versions, compare changes over time, and work concurrently on different features or bug fixes through branching. Unlike traditional centralised version control systems, Git operates on a distributed model, meaning that every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. This feature not only enhances performance but also allows for offline work, empowering developers to commit changes locally before pushing them to a shared repository.
Git's flexibility and efficiency make it an essential tool for modern software development. Its ability to handle large projects with numerous contributors while maintaining a clear history of changes has made it the go-to choice for developers worldwide. As you dive deeper into Git, you will discover its myriad features, including staging, merging, and conflict resolution, which further enhance collaboration and streamline the development process. Understanding Git is crucial for any developer looking to improve their workflow and contribute effectively to team projects.

In this note i’ll get in details about Version Control Systems and git, since you know… i kinda really need to understand this shit.
One thing to note is that modern version control like Git have not only just the latest snapshots (your latest code), but the whole repository mirrored, with all the changes, with all the versions of the code, so when people work in a project, every post is a full backup with the *version database*.# Git
